  text: 'Hi Gareth,<br>It was good to talk today and to find you as sharp as ever on the events of the day. While it was also good to hear from you and Amy at Christmas we were very sad to hear that your illness has got worse and that you are having a very bad time. At our time of life it\u2019s inevitable that old friends are hit by illness but it\u2019s still a shock when it happens and you have always been such a lively, larger than life, good friend that it shocked us both. Please accept our love and best wishes as your fight goes on. Life has taken us to places that we wouldn\u2019t have predicted when we first met almost 50 years ago in the smoke-filled Labour Party office of Emrys Jones in Charles Street, Cardiff after I and Rhys David (then of the Western Mail and later of the Financial Times) called to join the Labour Party.  You and I worked to get Wales Radical off the ground and to argue the case for devolution to Wales. I\u2019m convinced that our work helped to keep devolution alive the defeat in 1979 and prepared the ground for 1997.  Shortly afterwards you took me to my first meeting of the Rhiwbina Labour Party, in the Wendy Hut in the old Garden Village. It started with the classic debate over the minutes of the last meeting, with John Wilson and Bill Kohnstamm quibbling over virtually every line.  I remember saying to you after we came out of the meeting \u201cHow on earth can the ward party put up with two people who hate each other so much?\u201d and you told me \u201cThey don\u2019t hate each other \u2013 they\u2019re the best of friends\u201d. True \u2013 but it didn\u2019t make their pedantic bickering any easier to cope with!  When we first met, I would have confidently predicted that I would move on from Cardiff after a couple of years and that you would have stayed in Welsh politics for many years \u2013 wrong on both counts! I\u2019ve watched with amazement and respect at the career you carved out in such a challenging international environment. To have a Welshman \u2013 and one who retained such pride in Wales and his Welshness \u2013 playing such a significant international role and rising to the top of such a key international institution has been inspirational.  The work that you undertook with the ILO established international standards that were important for developing countries and those outside the West but are now of vital importance to Britain and the US and to Europe where so many things we hold dear are increasingly under threat.  Yesterday Andrew Adonis has resigned as Chair of the National Infrastructure Commission because of the Government\u2019s policy over Brexit \u2013 which he describes as a \u201cdangerous populist spasm\u201d. Politics has gone mad in both the UK and in the USA but perhaps the rest of the world will take up the baton of leadership.  One can but hope\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026  In any event, the one thing I regret is not spending more time in keeping in touch. Being the first Police & Crime Commissioner for South Wales after 25 years in the House of Commons is such an opportunity to make things happen that it keeps me focussed \u2013 but as Mary reminds me \u201cfew people express regret at not spending more time in the office\u201d. <br>For now, we send our love and our hopes and prayers \u2013 to you and to Amy, Llewellyn and Rhys.<br>Best wishes,'

At a time when I was feeling deeply discouraged about a certain anti-intellectual element in a private club I\'d belonged to for many years, this cheerful Welshman showed up, challenging the unspoken taboo against questioning who wrote the works of a certain famous author. He then proceeded to work through the channels to get the Board\'s approval for a newly monthly luncheon group, to discuss the forbidden topic. Soon, his group was drawing as many attendees as the pre-existing orthodox group. <br>Gareth succeeds where others fail because of his unique combination of intelligence, determination, wide knowledge, and over-the-top people skills. Everyone loves him (except those intent on shutting down open discussion of a controversial topic).<br>We were always delighted the many times Gareth came to our home for our informal "movie nights," with lively discussions afterwards. He always contributed in his deeply knowledgeable and good-humored way.<br>Gareth, you will be remembered fondly by all whose lives you have touched. <br>Love,'

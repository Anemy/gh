  text: '&#x1f495;&#128591; feel our sweet prayers to Gareth and everyone surrounding him near and far, seen and unseen. So many wonderful memories of the babes - Llewelyn, Sam, and Alex born within 12 days of each other and all of us "old folks" becoming parents together! Will dig out some pictures especially of our time in the Adirondacks at Claire\'s with Amy and Suzanne climbing High Peaks and Chuck and Gareth holding fort/forth on the couch - napping, reading, talking and solving the world\'s problems! Then marvelous dinners, wine, conversations and young children asleep!'

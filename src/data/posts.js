  text: 'It has been such a privilege for Elisabeth and I to get to know Gareth and his family. The way we first met will remain lovingly engraved in our memory. At a time when I was feeling deeply discouraged about a certain anti-intellectual element in a private club I\'d belonged to for many years, this cheerful Welshman showed up, challenging the unspoken taboo against questioning who wrote the works of a certain famous author. He then proceeded to work through the channels to get the Board\'s approval for a newly monthly luncheon group, to discuss the forbidden topic. Soon, his group was drawing as many attendees as the pre-existing orthodox group. <br>Gareth succeeds where others fail because of his unique combination of intelligence, determination, wide knowledge, and over-the-top people skills. Everyone loves him (except those intent on shutting down open discussion of a controversial topic).<br>We were always delighted the many times Gareth came to our home for our informal "movie nights," with lively discussions afterwards. He always contributed in his deeply knowledgeable and good-humored way.<br>Gareth, you will be remembered fondly by all whose lives you have touched. <br>Love,'

Thank you also for getting me involved with the group -- I thought I was retiring but that turned out not to be the case. So much to admire about you and we are all in your debt.'

These skills are now the basis of most of my work.  I have such fond memories with your family and Genghis as well. Our work team was another family. The surprise birthday parties in the office- where one time the singing telegram turned out to be a gorilla and a fake police officer in our conference room that unfortunately scared everyone due to the Israeli protests happening down the street at the same time. <br>Thank you for sharing your leadership and advice.'

We were so lucky to have the boys be friends, have play dates with dinners, Halloween outings and mini vacations together.  Gareth, every single dinner we have with friends, we think and speak of you\u2014every single one! Charlie can not help himself to start to clear the table while people are still eating. You would plead with him to sit down and enjoy the food and wine and company and not rush the meal! You even offered to do all the dishes yourself, if he would learn to relax, just a bit. Such great advice we are reminded of all the time. Love you all, Godspeed,'
